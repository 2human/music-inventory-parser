Title: The Grounds and Rules of  Explained: or, An Introduction to the Art of Singing by Note.  Boston: J. Franklin, for S.
Description: Boston: J. Franklin, for S. Gerrish, 1721.  Lacks 1st unnumbered leaf with t. p., pp. 21-22 (of “Some brief and very plain Instructions for Singing by NOTE”).  Assumed to be 1st ed., ASMI 516, because p. 24 lacks beginning of “Postscript” and because Recommendatory Preface is undated on p. iii.  See ASMI, pp. 603, 606 et seq.  Peculiarities of this copy: what is described in ASMI as leaf [1] (recto blank; “Rules for tuning the Voice” on verso) is, here, 2 leaves pasted together; the following pairs of leaves have their blank versos + rectos pasted together (2+3, 4+5, 6+7, 8+9, 10+11, 12+13, 14+15, 16+leaf blank on both sides).
	44 tunes in MS. on recto of blank leaf following p. 24 of “Some brief and very 
		plain Instructions” + on 26 additional leaves following printed book; 
		at least 1 leaf missing (between leaves [20] + [21])
	all music written with diamond-shaped note-heads; some tunes lack bar 
		lines, having only lines at ends of phrases
	pitching numerals written here + there; these indicate an upper voice’s 
		interval above the bass, or (if written over a bass note) the bass’s 
		interval below the next voice up; examples: Evening Hymn, leaf [6] 
		verso, “5th” next to “Bass” signifies that the bass starts a 5th below the 
		medius part; Bromsgrove Tune, leaf [12] verso, “1” next to “Tenor” 
		signifies that the tenor starts in unison with the bass, and “8” over 
		tenor’s last note signifies that it ends an octave above the bass
	several different hands in evidence; these are not distinguished here
	almost all texted tunes have “Tate & Brady” listed as authors of text
	wide variety of numbers of voices, names of voice parts, + locations of 
		melody; all this noted below, with parts listed from top down
