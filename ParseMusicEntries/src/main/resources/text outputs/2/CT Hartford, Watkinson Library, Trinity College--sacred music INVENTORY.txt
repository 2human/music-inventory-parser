Title: The Royal Melody Complete: or The New Harmony of Zion
Description: rd ed., Boston: W. M’Alpine, 1767?]  Bound with: Williams, A[aron]. The American Harmony: or Universal Psalmodist.  Newburyport, Mass.: Daniel Bayley, 1769.   The American Harmony: or Universal Psalmodist is complete, with [4], 96 pp.  The Royal Melody Complete contains pp. [3]-13, [3] (leaf with pp. [2-3] is bound in such that some text disappears into the binding, and the outer edge of the leaf is about 1” short of the adjoining leaves), 1-6; 2 leaves (the first fragmentary, blank on its recto side, and presumably numbered 7 on its printed verso; the second numbered 8 on its printed recto side, blank on its verso), pp. 9-14, fragmentary pp. 1-2 (music), pp. 1-96 (music; complete leaf with pp. 1-2 of music supplied from another copy); therefore, The Royal Melody Complete lacks 1st pp. [1-2] (t.p. + blank verso) + 2nd pp. [15-16] (index + advertisement for M’Alpine).  With reference to Table I in ASMI, pp. 118-119, The Royal Melody Complete’s music is consistent with Content I on pp. 1-39 and consistent with Content IV[-VII] on pp. 81-96, suggesting that this is a composite copy.  Arguing for this being an issue of The Royal Melody Complete and not an issue of The American Harmony: or, Royal Melody Complete is the presence both of Tans’ur’s dedication on p. [3] and of the 2 leaves of engraved rudiments.  The “Advertisement” on p. [2] of The American Harmony: or Universal Psalmodist is dated “Newbury-Port, January 5th, 1769,” and the sample error in this vol.’s index given on pp. 124-125 of ASMI (Barnet listed in the index as on p. 44, and actually printed on p. 54) is present.

Description: 
	8 leaves with printed staff lines bound in after printed portion of book; MS. 			music on these leaves, on 5 leaves with hand-drawn staff lines sewn in 		after the first 8, and on a single smaller leaf laid inside back cover; all 			these leaves are numbered here a. l. [1-14] 
	MS. music appears to be mainly treble parts, with one part labeled “Tenor” +
		4 bass parts on additional leaves [11-12]; the 4 bass parts are all 			matched by treble parts for the same tunes earlier in the MS., perhaps 			suggesting that Anna Porter and Chester Loomis were friends who 			shared this book
		

Call number: M 2116 .G16
Inscription(s): inside front cover, “Treble”; preliminary leaf recto, “Anna 			Porter’s / Property”; “MS. adds.   a new set up      A. H. Pitkin’s copy” 			(pencil); a. l. [13] verso, “Chester Loomis”

Author: Gillet, Rodolphas.  MS. music book.  Undated, but repertory suggests the MS. was compiled ca. 1805; certainly no earlier than 1803, when Stephen Jenks + Elijah Griswold’s 
Title: The American CHarmony, which contains first (
Description: and sometimes the only) printings for some of the tunes here, was published.  Another source for this copyist was Timothy Swan’s New England Harmony (1801), which contains 13 of the tunes found here (many in their first printings).  94 pp., the first 21 numbered by the original owner (pp. 7-8 + 17-18 missing), pp. [69-74] fragmentary + with no MS. music, pp. [87-88] (containing Southwic[k?], [Upton], Mount Vernon) fragmentary + loose (laid in, in mylar sleeve).  Several leaves are missing after p. 21, but the numbers assigned here continue sequentially.  
	partial index of tunes on p. [94]
	MS. music is almost entirely sacred; mix of melodies, non-melodic parts, + 
		multi-voice settings; also 1 march tune; when there are multiple 
		voices including tenor, melodic incipit is taken from tenor

Author:  [Little, William, and William Smith, 
Title: The Easy I, 
Description: probably an edition published in 1817, for Websters and Skinners and Daniel Steele in Albany, N. Y.]  Contains only pp. 7-10, 15-18, 23-34, 39-118, so the precise edition can’t be determined.  However, reference to Irving Lowens’s “Check-list of Editions and Issues” of The Easy Instructor (pp. 292-310 of his Music and Musicians in Early America, New York: Norton, 1964) narrows down the possibilities.  No edition longer than 112 pp. appeared before 1817, and the presence of the tune Delight on p. 45 and the tune Exhortation on p. 102 (see Lowens’s Table XI, p. 305) suggests that this is a copy of Lowens edition Q, or possibly edition P (though P’s content needs to be checked to verify this), both published in 1817.  But there’s a wrinkle: Lowens’s Table VI, pp. 296-7, states that in edition Q, the title on p. 89 is “Easter Anthm,” whereas here it’s “Easter Anthem,” suggesting that this must be edition P, not Q, and that edition P, correcting this error, followed edition Q.  But edition P has 120 pp., and edition Q has 127, [1] pp.  Why make a correction in the title of a piece and re-issue the tunebook in a shorter form?  Note also that the title page of edition Q has “REVISED AND ENLARGED EDITION.” along the top of the page, whereas edition P’s title page lacks those words (see Lowens, pp. 309-10).  Lowens lists a copy of edition P, not Q, at the Watkinson Library (see pp. 303-4), but that is surely inventory no. 133, below.

Description: Robbins, Mary.  MS. music book.  Paged 4-114 by original owner in ink and pencil; this pagination has been continued through p. [118] to accommodate the final 2 MS. music entries.  Undated, but repertory suggests pre-1821, possibly pre-1811.
	MS. music is 3- and 4-voice settings of sacred tunes, with melody in treble or 
		tenor (or what appears to be tenor, by its position in the vocal line-
		up; evidence later in the MS. suggests that this third voice from the top 
		may be treble, at least in some cases); voices, when specified in the 
		MS., are listed here from top voice down; verses of text (usually 1 
		verse) copied at bottoms of pages
	index of MS. tunes on verso of last leaf (p. [138])


Call number: Music MS 18
Inscription(s): inside front cover, “Mary Robbins” (on slip of paper pasted to 
		front paste-down)

Author: Rogers, Jesse.  MS. music book.  Ca. 1712 (see inscription below)-after 1762 (1762 is 1st printing of a tune found in this MS., St. Martin’s [p. 71; not the St. Martin’s by William Tans’ur]).  Contents: 1) 2 leaves—unnumbered, or numbers no longer visible, most of first leaf detached, both leaves printed at right angles to the volume’s horizontal format (i. e., top of p. to left, bottom of p. to right)—from the rudiments section of a printed tunebook (1st p. headed “[G]AM[UT] / or, / 
Title: Scale of 
Description: ”; 2nd p. headed “The RULE for finding out your / Mi by Flatts.” with poem from John Playford’s tunebook starting “If that no Flat be set in B”; 3rd p. contains 16 staff-fragments with various musical symbols, starting with “A single and / double Bar.”; 4th p. blank; 4 photos); 2) 4 unnumbered leaves containing MS. rudiments (photo; also one tune, Exeter, with letter “A,” on leaf [2] verso + leaf [3] recto of this set); 3) 21 leaves, numbered by original owner on alternate facing versos + rectos; 4) pp. 22-120, numbered by original owner, + p. [121], blank; 6) laid inside back cover, 2 unnumbered leaves containing partial index (letter G on) of the tunes on the numbered leaves + pages, and “An Index for The Tunes at ye Beginning of the Book Sence ye Book was paged” (pp. between numbered versos + rectos of leaves with MS. music contain tunes identified by letters B-I, K-L, used like p. nos.; this 2nd index lists those tunes with their corresponding letters + nearest numbered p.). 
	MS. music is mostly 2-, 3-, and 4-voice psalm tune settings and anthems; 
		melody in tenor voice, unless otherwise specified
	secular entries are inventoried here
	mix of diamond and round notation; some entries have bar-lines, others only 
		have vertical lines to mark ends of phrases (which is which will be 
		evident in the incipit transcriptions here); some entries textless, 
		others have verse/s of text written at bottom of p. (sometimes with 
		indications of text meter: “Common Meeter,” “Longer Meeter,” 
		“Shorter Meeter,” etc.), others have text underlaid; psalm nos. + text 
		authors frequently supplied (most common are “I W.” [Isaac Watts] + 
		“TB” [Tate & Brady]; pp. 103-116 contain multiple verses for some of 
		the tunes
	key signatures occasionally omitted, or incomplete (e. g., Gm with just Bb in 
		the key signature)
	many entries have indications of the intervallic distance between each vocal 
		part + the other parts at the opening of the piece (e. g., Benedictus, leaf 
		21 verso: treble starts “A 4th Under The / Tenor A 5th above ye Bass,” 
		tenor starts “A 4th above ye Treble / An 8th above ye Bass,” bass starts 
		“An 8th Below ye Tenor / An 5th below ye Treble”); if these indications 
		are taken literally, treble frequently sings lower than tenor

Title: recto
Description: rectos; leaf [41] numbered “P 39” on recto + “P 40” on verso; leaf [42] numbered “41” on recto + “42” on verso; leaves [43-45] numbered “43”-“45” on versos; leaf [46] unnumbered; leaf [47] numbered “46” on recto; leaf [48] numbered “50” on recto + “51” on verso; leaf [49] numbered “52” on verso; leaf [50] numbered “53” on recto; leaves [51-53] unnumbered.  Leaves [48-53] are smaller and not bound in.  Psalm 3, started on leaf [49] verso, doesn’t continue on leaf [50] recto, which has Brookfield—suggesting that these last 6 leaves (at least) were numbered at some point after the music was copied, and after at least one leaf had been lost.
	repertory is mostly sacred, but secular tunes (most in blue ink or pencil) are 
		added here and there; these will be noted below
	leaf [1] recto is index to tunes on leaves [3]-[50], including 2 of the secular 
		tunes
	leaf [2] recto has ascending + descending scale (“The Eight Notes”), vocal 
		patterns (scale portions + leaps) for practicing various intervals, + 
		intervals from 3rd to 8ve in sequence (“Leaps”)
	all sacred entries have vocal parts labeled (from top down) “Treble,” 
		“Counter,” “Tenor,” “Bass”; these part names can be assumed except 
		where their absence is noted here; if a tune has 3 voices, the counter 
		is omitted; melody incipits taken from tenor voice

Title: The Grounds and Rules of Musick Explained: or, An Introduction to the Art of Singing by Note.
Description: th ed.]  Boston: for Samuel Gerrish, 1746.]  Lacks all before p. 5.
	no inscriptions
	bookplate of Charles T. Wells pasted inside front cover
	2 preliminary leaves contain MS. index of printed tunes, + of MS. tunes 
		through leaf [37] 
	MS. music appears on leaves bound in after printed book; the first 21 of these 
		were numbered by the original owner from leaf 17 (directly following 
		the 16th leaf of printed music) through leaf 38 (leaf 20 now missing), 
		with numbers (and MS. music) generally appearing on alternate facing 
		versos + rectos, as in the printed portion; leaf 32 is numbered 32 on its 
		recto side + 33 on its verso, so at this point the numbering used here 
		departs from the numbering in the source: leaves after leaf 32 
		numbered here [33-62]; last MS. entry is incomplete, so at least one 
		leaf is missing at the end 
	at least 2 different hands copied the MS. music here, with hand no. 2 starting 
		on leaf [40] verso: hand no. 1 copies mostly 3-voice settings, and uses 
		mainly diamond-shaped note-heads, with a gradual and inconsistent 
		change (starting at leaf 32 recto) towards round note-heads, 4-part 
		settings, and a looser, less formal style overall (if indeed this remains 
		the same hand throughout this portion of the MS.); hand no. 2 copies 
		only 4-voice settings (9 of them by William Billings), and uses round 
		note-heads
	see Karl Kroeger, “William Billings’s Music in Manuscript Copy and Some 
		Notes on Variant Versions of his Pieces,” Music Library Association 
		Notes, Second Series, vol. 39, no. 2, pp. 316-45, especially pp. 331-32)
	most entries through leaf [35] lack bar-lines, having instead lines denoting 
		ends of phrases
